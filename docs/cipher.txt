Assignment: You are responsible for implementing the ciphering feature.
This feature should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.
The cipher will be stored in a file named key.txt, stored in a folder,
ciphers, (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
This file will contain two lines, the first line is the actual letter,
the second line is the cipher match. When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated.
An example will be provided. Document this in cipher.txt.

      UML for Cipher.java
---------------------------------
            Constructor
+Cipher()
---------------------------------
             Methods
+getAltKey(String) : void
+decipher(String) : String
---------------------------------
            Variables
+key1 : String
+key2 : String
---------------------------------
            Cipher()
Purpose: Initialize the key1 and key2 value

Pseudocode: Initialized key1 and key2 to store the values that were in the first and second
line of key.txt
---------------------------------
            getAltKey(String)
Purpose: Read the encryption keys stored in key.txt so that it can be implemented in decrypt(String)
To switch key2 with whatever is in the altKey

Pseudocode: First, catch exceptions such as if altKey is null or if altKey.length != key.length.
Then, if no exceptions were thrown then reassign the value of key2 with whatever the altKey is

---------------------------------
         decipher(String)
Purpose: Get the encrypted text and then decrypt using the decryption key stored in key.txt.

Pseudocode: First check whether the length of key1 and key2 are the same length and that
the text being passed is not null. Then, Create a StringBuilder called
output to store the decrypted text. If they are the same length, then loop through each character in
the String text. For each character, store it in a variable called curr. Then, find the indexOf current
in key2. If it's found in key2, then use that to find and add onto output the corresponding key1 value
for that character. If it's not found key2, then output the original character that was found in the text.
Finally, you just return the toString() of output.
